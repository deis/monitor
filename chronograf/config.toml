# Chronograf configuration

# TCP address that Chronograf should bind to.
# Bind to localhost by default, so that Chronograf should be inaccessible from the public internet.
# If you do want Chronograf to be accessible to the public internet on port 10000, use the next line:
# Bind = "0.0.0.0:10000" # <- This will expose Chronograf to the public internet. Use with caution!
# Can be overridden with environment variable CHRONOGRAF_BIND.
Bind = "0.0.0.0:10000"

# Path to local database file to use or create for storing Chronograf application data.
# Can be overridden with environment variable CHRONOGRAF_LOCAL_DATABASE.
## NOTE - This means that if a container dies we lose everything
LocalDatabase = "/opt/chronograf/chronograf.db"

# Maximum response size in bytes, for queries that pass through Chronograf.
# Setting this to a reasonable value will ensure that your browser does not crash
# if a query results in an excessively large response.
# If you do have a query that is too large, you will see an error message about the
# query response being too large.
# Can be overridden with environment variable CHRONOGRAF_QUERY_RESPONSE_BYTES_LIMIT.
QueryResponseBytesLimit = 2500000
